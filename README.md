This repository contains the code for the project done on a hackathon conducted by InMobi. InMobi HackDay Summer 2015 during the 23rd and 24th of May2015. Our application is a disaster relief application. Basically this app helps, the relief team, in locating trapped victims after a disaster. We have two apps. One for the relief team (say A) and the other for the, to be, victim (say B). The app B constantly ( after the user has travelled a threshold distance, say 100m) updates the location of the victim and stores it in a server, when a disaster occurs, the app A plots the last known locations of the victims on a google map.
